    <h3 style="text-align:center; color:rgb(0, 98, 155);">Problem & Solution</h3>
    <p>With how uncertain and risky sports betting can end up being, this application will give predictions based on prior calculations that can help the end user make better decisions based on the predictions given. This is important because with how popular sports betting is, and how important losing or gaining money is, being able to reference a calculated prediction with no biases and only numbers, it can allow for safer bets, and consequently, better profits. Predictions will be weighted and will take into account recent games that will allow the predictions to stay up to date, game to game.</p>
    
    <h3 style="text-align:center; color:rgb(0, 98, 155);">Application Overview</h3>
    <p>The application will contain a user-friendly interface on a single spreadsheet that calculates and updates game-predicting probabilities for the NFL season as it occurs.</p>
    

    <h3 style="text-align:center; color:rgb(0, 98, 155);">Technology Overview</h3>
    <ul style="list-style-type: square;"><li>Microsoft VBA</li><li>Microsoft Excel (Google Sheets)</li><li>Massey Method Predictive Model</li><li>Colley Method Predictive Model</li></ul>

    <h3 style="text-align:center; color:rgb(0, 98, 155);">Proposal Last Updated:</h3>
    <p style="text-align:center;">4/7/2022 4:32pm Sprint 6</p>

    <h3 style="text-align:center; color:rgb(0, 98, 155);">Features List</h3>
    <ul style="list-style-type: square;"><li>Initializes predictions based on this season (2021) and last season (2020) to predict the results of the upcoming season (2022)</li><li>Users can input scores for the games as they happen in the 2022 season and the model will automatically adjust its weights in the algorithms to give a better prediction for the outcomes of future games in the season</li></ul>

    <h3 style="text-align:center; color:rgb(0, 98, 155);">Future Features List</h3>
    <ul style="list-style-type: square;"><li>More accurate weightings based on statistics and mathematical modeling</li><li>The ability to use our model to predict the outcomes of many other things than just NFL</li></ul>

    <h3 style="text-align:center; color:rgb(0, 98, 155);">Basic Technical Features List</h3>
    <ul style="list-style-type: square;"><li>The program will contain lots of intricate mathematical formulas and linear equations that need encapsulation</li><li>The user interface will be on a separate sheet from the main bodies of code and will require polymorphism</li><li>Because this is a predictive model, testing methods that are effective and efficient are crucial</li></ul>

    <h3 style="text-align:center; color:rgb(0, 98, 155);">Advanced Technical Features List</h3>
    <ul style="list-style-type: square;"><li>This will make use of VBA which is a language we have not used in this class as well as excel which is an interface we have not used</li><li>It will also use algorithms that require data to train so that they can be used</li><li>The model uses reinforcement learning since we will not know what outcome to expect from the algorithm since we can't know the outcome of future games. The algorithm will use trial and error with the knowledge it has from past experience</li></ul>

    <h3 style="text-align:center; color:rgb(0, 98, 155);">Expertise and Strengths of Our Team</h3>
    <ul style="list-style-type: square;"><li>David Abrutis - Familiarity with calculations and functions in Python, Javascript, etc. I am not familiar yet with Microsoft VBA</li><li>Brindyn Schultz - Familiarity with Microsoft VBA, Microsoft Excel and Google Sheets, linear algebra, and machine learning. Average to poor knowledge of the NFL. Unfamiliar with mathematical modeling</li></ul>

    <h3 style="text-align:center; color:rgb(0, 98, 155);">What will be the measure of success by the end of the 3 weeks</h3>
    <p>The program will hopefully return in-the-ballpark predictions, may not be the most precise, but for the allotted time it should be made well enough for it to do what was promised to a respectable extent</p>
